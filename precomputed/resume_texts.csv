the of two integrations (source and target integrations).as a of source integration, a webmethods provides the wsdl file to receive glog xml file from otm.received glog xml is converted into webmethods document type and mapped to canonical, and published to broker.webmethods target integration subscribes the published canonical from webmethods broker and generates edi210 files as per standard edi210 schema. the generated edi210 files are sent to trax through trading networks via as2 protocol. trax will send the 997 ack back to webmethods with the status of edi210 files. webmethods validate the received 997 files and send the 997’s with rejected status, to otm.otm cross checks the rejected edi210 files and resends the valid data. b) contribution gather requirements, analyze the existing canonicals. develop the interfaces flow service, create utility services, webservice descriptors.. create unit test plan and integration test plan documents with sample inputs from client. prepare all documents. provide testing in environments. a) description ge aviation supply chain is consolidating its legacy purchasing in to a single oracle ebusiness suite to and author the purchase orders. this requires building webmethods integrations to exchange po, supplier, item data between central oracle ebusiness suite and 22 legacy applications/erps. for pilot implementation, grand rapids legacy is chosen. the scope of the is to build integrations from pac oracle 12i instance to grand rapids legacy and vice-versa. there are total 21 legacy need to be integrated with pac instance. b) contribution create the plan, gathering the requirements. develop the interfaces flow service, create utility services, webservice descriptors and implemented http post. create unit test plan and integration test plan documents with sample inputs from client provide during the test phase. provide post production after the completion of the for 3 weeks a) description this integration is built to transport data from juliet erp to gexpro.it is implemented only for ou_pg_wind and ou_pg_can operating units. this connection will communicate purchase orders between the two systems. built edi outbound integration to send edi850 (purchase order) data to the partner and edi inbound integration to receive edi997 (acknowledgement) from the partner. b) contribution create the technical of edi850 and edi997 basing on the requirements gathered (this interface was split into publish and subscribing integrations). create partner profiles and processing rules in trading networks. develop the interfaces flow service, create utility services. create unit and integration test plan documents the sample inputs by the client. provide during the test phase. provide post production after the completion of the for 3 weeks a) description the objective of the oracle spatsl interface integration is to publish item, sbom data from oracle to spatsl database. on user button press in romeo erp to release the the bom data need to be synchronized with spatl ms sql server database in real-time. this cannot run in batch mode. b) contribution create the plan, gather the requirements. create technical documents. develop the interfaces flow service, create utility services. create unit test plan and integration test plan documents with sample inputs from client. configure adapters for db2, mssql. a) description the objective of this is to synchronize item details both in jenerp and smarteam system. after this integration, all the item will be in smarteam and there will be no manual intervention required for synchronizing it in the two systems. implemented the in 12 integrations (pub and sub model) the ack integrations b) contribution update the technical for 12 integrations. develop the interfaces flow service, creating utility services create unit test plan and integration test plan documents with sample inputs from client provide during the test phase. provide post production after the completion of the for 3 weeks. a) description any in cisco would be added in to the database. sends a request to registry (cr) create/update/assign/delete/inactivate. the decides the type of operation to be like create/update/delete/inactivate and sends the request message to the respective messaging queue. this interface
