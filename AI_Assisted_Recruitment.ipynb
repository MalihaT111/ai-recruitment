Additional Information: \\nLeading Change -I have been instrumental in development and implementation of the Adjutant General's Retention Research project, involving survey development and analyzing the results of the surveys to present to the Adjutant General to help retain the qualified talent of the Departments.  I have been tasked with working with the Federal Security Manager for the Joint Forces Headquarters in developing policies, procedures and processes to ensure that all current and new State Employees have the appropriate security clearances for the position held per the Federal Government Requirements.  While at LMIS, I lead the Job Vacancy Project and was able to produce results in less time and man hours than in years before with staff that were inexperienced in the JVC process and procedures.  I have been responsible to develop, plan and implement database programs, for the last three positions I have held.  These were designed to cultivate, involve, renew contact, and promote active and potential employees.  These databases were used for reporting FTE usage, budget management and turnover reports.  While working in the healthcare field, I took the initiative in creating a local website that was used to receive and respond to requests for information and assistance in marketing and promoting the healthcare facility along with recruitment of potential employees.  As Human Resource Coordinator in the healthcare field, I managed the front office personnel, reduced contract labor costs for nursing staff and implemented a unique pay structure to increase PRN staff utilization.  I continually think \"Outside-the-box\" to create and develop strategies to resolve issues faced in my work environment.

Some columns can be cut if they have too many null values or if they are not really relevant to the problem.

It was most likely used to identify the job posting on its original website. As well, \"Opening Date\" and \"Deadline\" may not have many null values, but these values might not be very useful to determine whether or not a candidate would be a good fit for a job."
