A consortium of 7\\r\\ninternational agencies implements the project with IntraHealth\\r\\nInternational Inc. as the lead. Partners include Abt Associates,\\r\\nEngenderHealth, PATH, Training Resources Group, American College of\\r\\nNurse Midwives and Save the Children. PRIME II currently works with the\\r\\ngovernment of Armenia to expand access to quality reproductive health\\r\\nservices at the primary level through development of updated national\\r\\npolicies and protocols and through pilot implementation of those new\\r\\napproaches in Lori Marz. PRIME II's Human Immunodeficiency\\r\\nVirus/Sexually Transmitted Infections (HIV/STI) project supports the\\r\\ngovernment of Armenia to strengthen its efforts to prevent further\\r\\nspread of STIs in the population through preparing primary care\\r\\nproviders to offer integrated STI management and prevention services and\\r\\nby educating communities around those primary care centers about\\r\\nservices and appropriate prevention practices.

By funding pilot projects on human rights\\r\\neducation through the European Youth Foundation, the Directorate of\\r\\nYouth and Sport seeks to actively contribute to the inclusion of human\\r\\nrights education in youth work practice and to encourage innovative\\r\\npractices and partnerships, both in formal and in non-formal education\\r\\ncontexts. \\r\\nThe pilot projects will allow for a more visible and direct impact of\\r\\nthe programme at local level. They are a necessary complement to the\\r\\nrest of the youth programme on human rights education and to the other\\r\\nactivities of the Directorate of Youth and Sport of the Council of\\r\\nEurope. \\r\\nSimilarly, the inclusion of pilot projects in the European programme may\\r\\nserve to give them greater visibility and recognition, as well as\\r\\nfacilitating the development of networks and of opportunities to share\\r\\nexpertise and experiences. This will be done by means of the Directorate\\r\\nof Youth and Sport publications and web sites. This may be completed by\\r\\nan evaluation meeting and a publication with examples of good practice\\r\\nin 2005. \\r\\nThis financial support to pilot projects should be seen as exceptional\\r\\nand limited to the duration of the programme. The European funding can\\r\\nnot replace the necessary local and/or national co-funding (in money or\\r\\nin kind).

The guard\\r\\ncannot accept applications, but will call DCHA/DG for someone to come to\\r\\nthe reception desk and accept the application. The courier must wait\\r\\nuntil the DCHA/DG representative arrives to accept the application. It\\r\\nis recommend that the applicant contact USAID in advance of any courier\\r\\ndelivery to ensure that someone will be available to receive the\\r\\napplication, which cannot be left unattended at the guard station.\\r\\nElectronic transmittal of the final application (including budget and\\r\\nbudget narrative) shall also constitute an official submission, but\\r\\nUSAID does not accept any responsibility for delays in transmission or\\r\\nreceipt. \\r\\nFrom among the applications, USAID will select those that it intends to\\r\\nfund and will proceed to negotiate an award with each successful\\r\\napplicant subject to the availability of funding. The final decision for\\r\\nfunding will be based on both a technical review and the availability of\\r\\nUSAID funding. USAID reserves the right to fund one or more or none of\\r\\nthe applications that may be submitted. All applications will be\\r\\nevaluated according to the criteria below. \\r\\nNote that all applicants may be subject to a pre-award financial review.\\r\\nFurther, organizations that believe they may not meet USAID\\'s financial\\r\\naccountability requirements are encouraged to submit their proposal in\\r\\npartnership with eligible U.S. or international, or regional\\r\\norganizations that are experienced with these requirements in order to\\r\\npromote sustainability of programs after USAID support ends. \\r\\n6. Review and Evaluation Process:  USAID will review all applications\\r\\nsubmitted prior to COB August 12, 2004 in an initial round of reviews.\\r\\nApplications submitted after August 12, 2004 will be reviewed\\r\\napproximately on a quarterly basis until January 31, 2005. \\r\\nPartner Eligibility Criteria \\r\\nPotential partners include: private voluntary organizations,\\r\\nfoundations, colleges and universities, civic groups, faith-based\\r\\ninstitutions, international organizations, private businesses and\\r\\nassociations, regional organizations, philanthropic organizations, and\\r\\nadvocacy groups. Potential for-profit applicants should note that USAID\\r\\npolicy prohibits the payment of fee/profit to the prime recipient under\\r\\ngrants and cooperative agreements. Forgone profit does not qualify as\\r\\ncost sharing or leveraging. Note that the preceding list of potential\\r\\npartners is for illustrative purposes only, as our criteria for\\r\\neligibility are broad. USAID welcomes other, new types of partners. \\r\\nUSAID encourages proposals that embrace our Global Development Alliance\\r\\n- a USAID initiative that seeks to leverage USG funds by matches from\\r\\nprivate sources, preferably not less than 1:1. To be counted as a GDA\\r\\ninitiative, there must be a clear expectation that USAID resources will\\r\\nbe at least matched one-to-one by all other resources combined, both\\r\\npublic (e.g., official, bilateral, multilateral, or governmental) and\\r\\nprivate (e.g., from companies, foundations, universities, NGOs, or\\r\\nindividuals), so long as private resources equal at least 25% of USAID\\'s\\r\\ncontribution. \\r\\nApplications are not required to include cost-sharing provisions.\\r\\nApplications that include additional in-kind and/or cash contributions\\r\\nfrom non-U.S. government sources will, however, be give special\\r\\nconsideration since cost sharing demonstrates a strong commitment to the\\r\\nproposed program. Cost sharing includes contributions, both cash and\\r\\nin-kind, which are necessary and reasonable to achieve program\\r\\nobjectives and which are verifiable from the recipient\\'s records. Cost\\r\\nsharing contributions may include volunteer services provided by\\r\\nprofessional and technical personnel, and un-recovered indirect costs.\\r\\nHowever, cost sharing does not include forgone profit. Applicants that\\r\\ndo not include such contributions are encouraged to provide a rationale\\r\\nfor not doing so. \\r\\nProgram Eligibility Criteria \\r\\nTo be considered for funding under this APS, proposed programs must meet\\r\\nall of the following requirements: \\r\\n- Proposals must have clearly-defined objectives that lead to\\r\\nempirically verifiable results through an effective methodology \\r\\n- Proposals should reflect some combination of the following factors;\\r\\nexpertise and/or experience, innovative and new ideas, effective use of\\r\\ntechnologies \\r\\n- Proposals must address one or more of the priorities and concerns\\r\\nlisted earlier in this APS \\r\\n- Proposals must offer promise of significant development impact, as\\r\\nmeasured, for example, by the number of direct and indirect\\r\\nbeneficiaries of the program, and/or by the potential for replication or\\r\\nscaling-up over time \\r\\n- Proposals must be feasible from a technical, economic, financial, and\\r\\nsocial perspective \\r\\nSelection Criteria for Applications \\r\\nThe criteria listed below will serve as the basis upon which all\\r\\napplications will be evaluated. Technical aspects of the applications,\\r\\nevaluated according to the criteria below, will constitute 40 points of\\r\\nthe total evaluation, and must demonstrate the likelihood that the\\r\\nproposed program will be successful in achieving its objectives.\\r\\nApplicants\\' organizational experience, past performance, and quality of\\r\\nkey staff will constitute 40 points of the evaluation; this will include\\r\\nan assessment of the applicants\\' ability to achieve expected results\\r\\nwithin a reasonable time frame. The remaining 20 points will be based on\\r\\nfairness and reasonableness of costs. \\r\\n1. Technical Approach - 40 points \\r\\nApplications shall have a clear definition of the problem which the\\r\\ngrant activity intends to address, supported by reliable data and\\r\\nconsultations with the local communities and appropriate host country\\r\\norganizations to the extent necessary; clearly define the nature of\\r\\nintervention/s that will be provided and strongly establish the\\r\\nrelationship of these interventions with defined problem; interventions\\r\\nmust focus on problem solving rather than simply problem identification.\\r\\nThe application shall have a strong likelihood of appropriate\\r\\nsustainability with a sensible scheme for addressing this concern. USAID\\r\\nwill look for evidence of broad-based local support, including evidence\\r\\nof significant local contributions from participant \"stakeholders\" as\\r\\nwell as other entities that are sympathetic with the proposed activity.\\r\\nFurther, applications shall have an evaluation and reporting plan\\r\\nincorporating such critical elements as: impact indicators,\\r\\ngender-disaggregated data collection, monitoring, program audit,\\r\\npreparation of financial status reports, and progress reports. USAID\\r\\nwill give priority to applications that demonstrate innovative\\r\\napproaches in reaching and engaging the participation of target\\r\\nbeneficiaries, host country agencies, and other stakeholders as well as\\r\\nincorporate, as appropriate, a well defined system for selecting\\r\\ndeveloping and strengthening the organizational and management\\r\\ncapabilities of local communities and counterpart agencies. \\r\\n2. Institutional Qualifications/Past Performance/Personnel - 40 points \\r\\nApplications will be evaluated on both past performance as well as\\r\\nprogram intentions. Applications should demonstrate a thoroughness and\\r\\nunderstanding of management principles, technically sound planning and\\r\\noperations management, and the capabilities necessary to successfully\\r\\nmanage the program; including USAID regulations. If a sub-grant\\r\\nmechanism is proposed, the applicant must demonstrable the ability to\\r\\nmanage and implement such a program. Proposed key staff should have\\r\\nsuccessful, verifiable, and recent experience and there should be\\r\\ndemonstrable experience in developing and sustaining effective,\\r\\ncollaborative work with grant stakeholders, other organizations, and\\r\\nhost country representatives. Previous experience in the development and\\r\\nimplementation of strategies that contribute to the functional\\r\\nreintegration of people with disabilities, especially those requiring\\r\\nwheelchairs, will be appropriately recognized \\r\\n3. Cost Considerations - 20 points \\r\\nApplications will be evaluated on both the fairness and reasonableness\\r\\nof all proposed costs, cost sharing and the extent to which local buy-in\\r\\n(not necessarily financial) is demonstrated. \\r\\nUSAID reserves the right to make multiple grants or no awards at all\\r\\nthrough this APS. Programs selected for funding will be based on the\\r\\nscore of the technical evaluations, evidence or organizational\\r\\nresponsibility, USAID priorities, ability and willingness of concerned\\r\\nUSAID Missions to award and manage the activity, and the availability of\\r\\nfunds. If the results of USAID\\'s assessment are not positive, written\\r\\nnotification will be provided to the applicant. If the results are\\r\\npositive, the selected organization will be notified. Additional\\r\\ninformation and program revisions may be required.\\r\\n7.
