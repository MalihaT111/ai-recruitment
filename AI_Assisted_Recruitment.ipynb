        "Since there are many columns in job_posts_df with null values, we can use reasoning to drop some of the rows or columns. Some columns can be cut if they have too many null values or if they are not really relevant to the problem.  For example, the column \"AnnouncementCode\" has 17793 null values and the unique non-null values are a random string of letters. It was most likely used to identify the job posting on its original website. As well, \"Opening Date\" and \"Deadline\" may not have many null values, but these values might not be very useful to determine whether or not a candidate would be a good fit for a job."
